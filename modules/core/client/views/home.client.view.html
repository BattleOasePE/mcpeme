      <accordion-group heading="Where is the old mcpe.me?">
        The old version of mcpe.me has been decommissioned and replaced with this website.
      </accordion-group>
      <accordion-group heading="How do I create a record?">
        You will need to create an account and sign in. Then you can click "Records" and "Create records" in the menu bar. Enter your details and your record will be created instantly.
      </accordion-group>
      <accordion-group heading="What is 'content'? What do I put in that box?">
        What you put in "content" depends on your record type, but it should be some way to connect to your server.
        <ul>
          <li><b>CNAME</b> should be your existing hostname (eg: foo.example.com)</li>
          <li><b>A</b> should be your server IPv4 address (eg: 1.2.3.4)</li>
          <li><b>AAAA</b> should be your server IPv6 address (eg: 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)</li>
        </ul>
      </accordion-group>
      <accordion-group heading="Will this website create a server for me?">
        <b>No.</b> mcpe.me takes your existing server and gives it a nice hostname, we don't create servers. There are plenty of other services that do a great job creating servers and you should try one of those. These services cost money, but that is only logical, running a server does cost money.
      </accordion-group>
      <accordion-group heading="What is verification? How can I verify my server?" panel-class="panel-success">
        Verification is a process which ensures that the record owner is also the server owner. Only MCPE servers can be verified. You may be requested to verify your server by our staff for security reasons. <br><br>
        You can verify a server by setting the title of the server to the "Record ID" and restarting the server. mcpe.me will verify you server a few seconds after you add the server. If your server is confirmed to be an MCPE server (but doesn't have the verification code set), mcpe.me will try again in 20 minutes. You can force mcpe.me to re-verify by submitting the edit form without any changes. Verification is <b>not</b> instant, it will take about 15 second for mcpe.me to complete a verification.
      </accordion-group>
      <accordion-group heading="Do you accept donations? What are donations spent on?">
        I accept personal donations to my PayPal. You can send money to <code>me@falkirks.com</code> or my using my <a href="https://www.paypal.me/falkirks">paypal.me link</a>. If you would like to receive a "donator" rank on mcpe.me, you <b>must</b> add your mcpe.me username in the note. <br><br>
        Donations are primarily used to reimburse the money I pay out of my own pocket to run this service and other MCPE related services. They will also be used to pay for useful things like food and servers for new projects.
      </accordion-group>
      <accordion-group heading="What are all these tokens and keys?">
        The new service generates and uses an array of tokens and key to operate.
        <ul>
          <li>User ID - this is a unique identifier for a user that can't be changed. It is useful for reporting users.</li>
          <li>Record ID - this is a unique identifier for a record that can't be changed. It is useful for requesting support with records.</li>
          <li>CF ID - each record is assigned an ID by CloudFlare. This ID may change over the course of the record's life and is only used internally.</li>
          <li>Record API key - each record has a key generated for performing remote updates on it. This key is not yet used.</li>
        </ul>
